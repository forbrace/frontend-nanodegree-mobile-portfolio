## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

<a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio">Initial project assets</a>

The challenge is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques descirbed up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

In order to deliver the fastest possible time to first render, we need to optimize three variables:

* Minimize the number of critical resources.
* Minimize the number of critical bytes.
* Minimize the critical path length.

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code.

### Getting started

1. Check out the repository

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
